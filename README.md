## Virtual Environments and Requirements

There is a file call requirements.txt which contains a list of all the external libraries and frameworks.

1. Use a virtual environment.
2. Enter: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - this will install all requirements in the list
  
---
If you need to pip install something else do so in the virtual environment:

1. Then Enter: `pip freeze -> requirements.txt`
  - `pip freeze` shows all the installed things
  - the whole command pipes the output into the requirements file so it is always up to date
